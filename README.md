 1)Veil Framework - Payload Creation
This repository contains the work completed during my internship, focusing on creating payloads using the Veil Framework. Veil is an advanced tool used for generating various types of payloads, primarily aimed at bypassing antivirus detection. This project dives into the creation, testing, and deployment of these payloads within a controlled environment.
Project Objectives:
1.Understand the Veil Framework: Gain a deep understanding of how the Veil Framework operates, including its architecture and functionalities.
2.Payload Creation: Create different types of payloads using the Veil Framework and customize them for specific use cases.
3.Antivirus Evasion: Test the generated payloads to evaluate their effectiveness in evading antivirus software.
4.Security Best Practices: Ensure that all payload generation and testing were done ethically, within a controlled lab environment, and with proper authorization.

Ethical Considerations:
This project is purely educational and should only be used in environments where you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use of these techniques can be illegal and unethical.

2) Information Gathering (Reconnaissance Attack) on College Websites
This repository contains the work related to information gathering, also known as reconnaissance, targeting college websites. This project involves techniques and tools used to collect information about the target systems to understand their vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors.
Project Objectives
1.Understand Reconnaissance Techniques: Explore different methods of information gathering, including passive and active reconnaissance.
2.Target Identification: Identify and select college websites for information gathering based on defined ethical parameters.
3.Data Collection and Analysis: Gather data related to the target websites, such as domain names, IP addresses, server details, and potential vulnerabilities.
4.Ethical Hacking Practices: Ensure that all reconnaissance activities were conducted ethically, without exploiting vulnerabilities or compromising systems.

Ethical Considerations:
This project is intended for educational purposes only. All reconnaissance activities should be performed with explicit permission from the target institutions. Unauthorized information gathering can be illegal and unethical.
